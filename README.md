# PreDoc
Before my PhD, I followed some courses in Sorbonne University. I focused on deep learning subjects.
I took 4 courses :

*   **AMAL** : Deep Learning in text application and generation
*   **RDFIA** : Deep Learning in visual application
*   **REDS** : Learn tools to create a project and write scientif project. 
*   **Machine and Deep Learning : Apprentissage statistique** : Courses to introduce at financials mathematicien how machine and deep learning work. 

Behind I also make some **personal project** to understand better each courses and their issues.
